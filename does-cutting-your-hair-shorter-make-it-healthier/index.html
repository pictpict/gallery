<h3 id="however-how-you-treat-your-hair-can-affect-how-thick-and-healthy-it-looks">However, how you treat your hair can affect how thick and healthy it looks.</h3><p>The shorter your hair, the healthier it is. Long hair is a pain. Your hair will most likely look healthier after making a change. If you�re active like me, layers quickly become the enemy.
