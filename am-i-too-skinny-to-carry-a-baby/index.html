<p>I have a healthy child now so i’m least bothered about what people say, but it did affect me at the time when people indirectly suggested that i was unfit to carry a baby just because i’m petite.

<p>I�m not really sure what to think. I know a few people who feel they are to thin and i always say this. I see slim people moving around quit. Our abs don’t need to grow all that big in order to support our lighter bodies. But in reality, healthy babies come in all shapes and sizes.</p>

<p>Now that it is warming up, i�m hoping that walking will help put some muscle on and fill out my pants again. I think the only thing worse than people watching you lose baby weight, might be actually losing the damn baby weight. If the body is very straight, like a poker, or the hips are sunken in, that is.</p>

<p>We aren’t carrying around a bunch of heavy fat. Ladies want the hourglass figure. Ideally, the ferret should be a straight shape, with a slight bulge at the hips. If a woman really wants the best for her child she should try living a really healthy lifestyle. Gaining too much, or too little, impacts the child’s fetal development and those.</p>

<p>I would die because of my uglyness. If your ferret is shaped like a bowling pin, well, he�s a bit chubby! Mothers should gain about 10% weight during their pregnancy (assuming they’re a normal weight to begin with). If you are really struggling, then please consult a doctor! When you or someone close to you look like they�ll break into.</p>
