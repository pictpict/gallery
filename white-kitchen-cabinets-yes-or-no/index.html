<p>As we mentioned, most kitchens have ceilings that are 8 feet or 9 feet high, and if this is the case for you, there are a few options: Yes to a 4 simple crown and no decor items on top of your cabinets. However, have two young children, a dog, a cat and a messy husband, as well as a large mudpit of a garden and access to the garden (and back in!!) is only through the kitchen. My new kitchen (nearly finished yay!!!) is white units and white tiles and currently white walls and ceiling.</p>

<p>We saved the most popular for last. I do not think your cabinets are too casual for a simple crown. It is also recommended to remove the hardware during this process. 5 coats later and the wood was still showing through. White marble for the kitchen, yes or no? Slim and softer, the kitchen soffit is probably situated in one of the small cupboards at the lower segment.</p>
