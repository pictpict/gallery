<p><strong>Does Depression Cause Hair Loss</strong>, I say this because if you are suffering from clinical depression and believe it is the reason for your hair loss you are almost certainly wrong. Depression can lead to a feeling of low mood, lack of interest or pleasure in activities, loss of energy, and sleep deprivation.</p>

The main cause of hair loss is stress. Hair loss is not a typical symptom of depression, but depression can indeed be responsible for hair loss in severe forms of depression.</p>
<h3 id="can-depression-cause-hair-loss">Can depression cause hair loss?</h3><p>The main cause of hair loss is stress. The type of hair loss generally caused by antidepressants is called telogen effluvium.telogen effluvium occurs when your body is stressed in some way—perhaps by childbirth, illness, surgery, mental stress, poor nutrition, or medication—which causes hair follicles to enter into the resting stage (telogen phase). It often seems that those that live in constant fear about losing their hair may actually contribute to their own hair loss, by giving themselves so much stress and anxiety that their hair may fall out. Large clumps of hair may suddenly fall out for no apparent reason, causing patches of hair loss. The process of going bald is still bound up with a loss of virility and masculinity, in a way that the menopause is often linked to a loss of femininity for women. While experts haven’t found evidence to suggest depression directly causes hair loss, depression may have a more indirect role in thinning hair.</p>
