Still, belt drive opener will often cost a little more to replace than chain drive opener. Key differences between chain drive and belt garage door openers column if you�re installing your first automatic garage door opener or replacing your current opener, you�ll find that there are different types of openers to choose from.</p>
<h3 id="the-difference-is-that-the-chain-and-pulleys-are-both-made-from-metal-so-they-are-much-stronger">The difference is that the chain and pulleys are both made from metal, so they are much stronger.</h3><p>A chain drive opener uses a roller chain and pulley apparatus. Somewhat confusingly, dc motors are rated in hps (horsepower similar) or hpc (horsepower comparable). However, if your garage door is tall (usually 8 feet or more), you�ll need one with a rail long enough to accommodate the height. Like a chain drive, the belt drive operates by moving the rubber belt. Automatic garage doors come with a section of metal that opens and closes every time you use the door (without requiring any manual assistance). Also, if yours is particularly heavy or has double doors, you might need one with extra horsepower.</p>
